## Introduction

Turing’s theory of pattern formation has been used to describe the formation of self-organized periodic patterns in many biological, chemical, and physical systems. However, the use of such models is hindered by our inability to predict, in general, which pattern is obtained from a given set of model parameters. While much is known near the onset of the spatial instability, the mechanisms underlying pattern selection and dynamics away from onset are much less understood. Here, we provide physical insight into the dynamics of these systems. We find that peaks in a Turing pattern behave as point sinks, the dynamics of which is determined by the diffusive fluxes into them. As a result, peaks move toward a periodic steady-state configuration that minimizes the mass of the
diffusive species. We also show that the preferred number of peaks at the final steady state is such that this mass is minimized. Our work presents mass minimization as a potential general principle for understanding pattern formation in reaction diffusion systems far from onset.
